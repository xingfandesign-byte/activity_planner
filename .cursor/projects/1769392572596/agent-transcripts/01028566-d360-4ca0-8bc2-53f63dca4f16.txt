what does this mean and how to run

The user is asking about a code selection from QUICKSTART.md. They want to know what it means and how to run it. Let me first read the full QUICKSTART.md file to understand the context better.

Reading QUICKSTART.md for context.

[Tool call] read_file
  target_file: /Users/xingfan/weekend-planner/QUICKSTART.md

[Tool result] read_file

Now I understand. The user is asking about lines 6-9, which show:
```bash
cd weekend-planner
./run.sh
```

This is a bash script command that:
1. Changes directory to `weekend-planner`
2. Runs the `run.sh` script

Let me check if the run.sh file exists to see what it does, and also check the directory structure to give a complete answer.

Checking `run.sh` to see what it does:

[Tool call] read_file
  target_file: /Users/xingfan/weekend-planner/run.sh
[Tool call] list_dir
  target_directory: /Users/xingfan/weekend-planner

[Tool result] read_file

[Tool result] list_dir

Perfect! Now I have all the information I need. The user is asking about:
1. What the commands mean
2. How to run them

The commands are:
- `cd weekend-planner` - changes directory
- `./run.sh` - runs the startup script

The run.sh script:
- Sets up a Python virtual environment if needed
- Installs dependencies
- Starts the backend server on port 5000
- Starts the frontend server on port 8000
- Opens the browser (according to the QUICKSTART.md)

I should explain this clearly to the user.
</think>
## What it means

The commands:
1. `cd weekend-planner` — changes into the `weekend-planner` directory
2. `./run.sh` — runs the startup script

## What `run.sh` does

- Sets up a Python virtual environment (if needed)
- Installs backend dependencies
- Starts the backend API server on port 5000
- Starts the frontend web server on port 8000
- Keeps both running until you press Ctrl+C

## How to run

From your current location (`/Users/xingfan`), run:

```bash
cd weekend-planner
./run.sh
```

Or if you're already in the `weekend-planner` directory:

```bash
./run.sh
```

Make sure the script is executable:
```bash
chmod +x run.sh
```

After running, you should see:
- Backend API at `http://localhost:5000`
- Frontend app at `http://localhost:8000` (opens automatically)

Press Ctrl+C to stop both servers when you're done.

Note: The script requires Python 3. If you get a "permission denied" error, make the script executable with `chmod +x run.sh`.
